## Triangle Classification

A python program is is implemented here, which classify triangles based on their side lengths. 
In the program, it will determine whether the triangle is EQUILATERAL, ISOSCELES, SCALANE OR RIGHT ANGLED. 
It even handles the invalid imputs light negative entry, zero and triangle inequalities. 

## Files included in the program are:

There is -classify_triangle.py which contain the logic s for triangle classification. 
And -test_classify_triangle.py which contains automated tests, using pytest.

"python classify_triangle.py" for running the program
"python -m pytest -v" for running test.
